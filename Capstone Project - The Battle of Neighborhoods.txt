Capstone Project - The Battle of Neighborhoods


Introduction/Business Problem:
SuperFit, a new gym company, would like to open a new gym in Paris, France. They would like to open this gym in a district where it would have the least competition.


Paris is composed of 20 different districts. SuperFit would like to open its new gym in the district where the number of inhabitants per gym is the highest.


Data:
Competition: We will use the Foursquare API to map the different existing gyms in Paris


Paris data: We are going to scrape data from the following wikipedia page (https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrondissements_de_Paris) in order to have the number of inhabitants per disctrict


We are going to use the JSON file on this page (https://www.data.gouv.fr/en/datasets/arrondissements-1/) in order to map the different disctricts on a Folium map


Once we have all those data, we will be able to calculate the number of inhabitants per gym and we will be able to make a proposition to SuperFit about where it could be interesting to open the new gym.
